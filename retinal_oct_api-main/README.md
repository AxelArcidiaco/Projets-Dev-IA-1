Model for detecting retina damage from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Images, using Transfer Learning on VGG16 CNN Model.
## Context
Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to capture high-resolution cross sections of the retinas of living patients. Approximately 30 million OCT scans are performed each year, and the analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time (Swanson and Fujimoto, 2017).
